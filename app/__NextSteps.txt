--- done --- bind keyboard keypresses to actions (maybe this is via an invisible text input which takes focuses?)
--- done --- Inter-map travel by town border exit
--- done --- button is slow to trigger. kb is fine. done? -- FIGURE OUT WHY THE LAND COMMAND IS NOT IMMEDIATE !!!
--- done --- death - hp <= 0 - (Probably can/should make the message part of the view template)
--- done --- fly mode and land/launch restriction now set by vehicles:
+-- done --- LaunchOrLand (verify use of vehicle fly property plane-fly, rocket-orbit (although eventually it goes into space mode))
+-- done --- plane landing now checks against passability and gives "- Not here!!" when not possible.
--- done --- xit now allowed
+-- done --- Vehicle in/out logic -- reverification of terrain restrictions/freedoms
+-- done --- xit prevented while flying (be careful of spaghetti...)
--- done --- Terrain filtering player movement


### In not so particular order, we must:

refactor where player array index from xy is calculated (centralize this) and add a terrain at location function to centralize that as well.

make a quick space mode which maps to included map xyz space locations and on land, set map and orbit mode (launch message suppressed)
Ensure that leaving space mode goes to gameplay mode, orbiting in vehicle (presumably, the rocket)
include death for failed rocket landing (play ult to figure out what kills and what strands)
provide a way to use current data to allow safe (or maybe killing?) landings for flying vehicles

Retool rocket launch to start space mode
finish out actual space mode -- not really hard to do
--+ make a hyperspace animation
--+ leaving space by orbit puts game mode into rocket flying

Suppress the land plane message when leaving a map in a flying plane

Determine how P will work on virtual keyboard, it does nothing now

Add keyboard mapping masks to prevent stupid things (like player action or ai in zats screen, or xit while flying, etc.)

Character creation and/or default (see ultima 2 for "Gandalf")

Objects strategy (probably just an array for items and an array for mobs, but...)

Inter-map travel by town entry

Verify prevention of entering towns in a vehicle

Inventory use/population/templating

Inventory consumption (eg: food per step), 
required inventory for vehicle function, 
hitpoint drain in swamps and (electrical)field, 
damage prevention/avoidance ala inventory (eg: ring protects against field damage, magic boots against swamp),
starvation (food gone, still stepping)
unlock doors lose a key

mobs
movement ai (wander, seek)
killable
inventory gain for death (xp, gold, items, tools)
combat ai, including thief steal

ensure flying does not permit ai motion

mob transactions
simple 1 line comment
auto-donate (eg: Lord Brittish)
gold offering (eg: father antos, the quickblade guy)
steal from mobs (uhh... does this actually even work??)

mob transaction across a counter
simple y/n purchase (eg: food, also covers 'tip' part of pub below)
multiple option, single level store (eg: weapons)
two-path transaction (eg: pubs [food, tip])
steal from counters

spells?  at very least mob spells (sleep(winged demon [balron?]), paralyze legs(demon), paralyze arms(pike demon), magic missle(wizard))

timing (inaction - pass, multiple pass - game speed)

time doors
timed appearance/disappearance
inter-map travel by timedoor

save/load games

quests (maybe by way of hidden inventory and "Win" conditions reliant upon it)
blessing to ring
minax death to win

dungeon mode - easily the shittiest mode of all, not necessary, and likely not so trivial.  Could actaully go with a 'sword of fargaol' remake easter egg on this on a switch or something?

Config for legacy bugs: switches in and true, but unused -- ensure known ult2 bugs exist (provide a switch for turning them off individually)
--+ bump swamp in ship == player damage
--+ invincible guard in each city
--+ ship duplication
