[_] 001) screwy flying
	launch and land works but flying is kind of screwy.
	input acceptance handler shouldn't just be assumed 
	to be the normal game tick, it should fork on mode.
	food ahouldn't be consumed while flying, nor should 
	effects or ai proc. all 3 things happen on accepted
	input while flying since it all goes through normal 
	channels. fix by adding additional overall input 
	handler for flying mode.

[_] 002) invalid action while flying
	all input should ignore if not l or movement while
	flying. should be resolved woth 001. between that
	and the more robust input handling stuff.
