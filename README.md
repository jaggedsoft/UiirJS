NOTE: This repo is not current, but will be made so soon (date of writing: April 13, 2014).  It's overdue for code cleanup, and has had the UI logic revamped and the input mechanisms are being reworked right now.  Look for a push with these changes, and the addition of two more libraries (ONEA and Incoming, for input) at github.com/obviouslysorna within the next month.


UiirJS
======

Javascript incarnation of a remake of a certain game I've loved since the early 1980's.  
This time, I'm aiming for a high fidelity to the original, which should limit the amount of thinking I've previously done about supporting boatloads of user customization, and make it a little easier to manage.
